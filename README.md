# Homework #1

<!---Added the in-class participation files (Class Excercise #3) to this repo by mistake. But then I found a way to delete them. But left this comment here as a testimony of what happened.-->

This is the **README.md** file written in *Markdown* for **STAT 454** aka *the best stats class ever*.

You can check out the class [website](http://stat545.com/) and my *[Participation repo](https://github.com/dirediredocks/STAT454_Participation)*.
